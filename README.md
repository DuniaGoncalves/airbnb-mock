## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML & CSS
Working on this static page I put everything I have learned into practice. First off I divided the work I did into sections; header, where I included the nav, the body, and the footer. Within the nav I have a hover effect going over the menu items and the footer list. I finally got the hero image to stay put and not look distorted. I used flexbox to get all the images on the page to fall into place. 

## Lessons Learned:
Flexbox was a little tricky but once I understood the concept I find it to be a useful too. While doing this project I learned to do all the work that I know first and then come back and tackle parts that are slightly more difficult. 

## Future Updates:
* Give the seach bar a cleaner look
* Add Responsiveness
